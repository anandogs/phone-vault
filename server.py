I, the undersigned, hereby acknowledge that:

1. PHONE USAGE RULES:
   - I will use the phone ONLY for the stated purpose
   - I will set a timer for maximum {random.randint(5, 15)} minutes
   - I will place the phone on airplane mode when not actively needed
   - I will avoid all social media, news, and entertainment apps

2. PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION:
   - First offense: 24-hour vault lockdown
   - Second offense: 48-hour vault lockdown
   - Third offense: 72-hour vault lockdown
   - Egregious violations: The guardian may implement custom punishments

3. EMERGENCY EXCEPTIONS:
   - True emergencies involving health, safety, or critical deadlines
   - Must be pre-approved by answering additional disciplinary questions

4. COMMITMENT:
   I understand that the phone is a tool, not a toy. I respect the vault's purpose 
   and the guardian's wisdom in limiting my access.
